# Easy Contact Form Setup with Formspree (GitHub Pages)

Formspree is the easiest way to add a working contact form to your GitHub Pages site. No complex configuration needed!

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Formspree Account
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Create a New Form
1. Click "New Form" in your dashboard
2. Enter form name: "Portfolio Contact Form"
3. Set email to: `nqmasilela777@gmail.com`
4. Click "Create Form"

### Step 3: Get Your Form ID
After creating the form, you'll see a form endpoint like:
```
https://formspree.io/f/xpznvqko
```
Your Form ID is the part after `/f/` (e.g., `xpznvqko`)

### Step 4: Update Your Code
In `pages/contact.tsx`, replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Form ID:

```typescript
// Change this line:
const formspreeResponse = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID', {

// To this (using your actual Form ID):
const formspreeResponse = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/xpznvqko', {
```

### Step 5: Deploy and Test
1. Commit your changes to GitHub
2. Push to your repository
3. GitHub Pages will automatically deploy
4. Test your contact form
5. Check your email!

Your contact form is now working. When someone submits the form:
1. You'll receive an email at `nqmasilela777@gmail.com`

  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required>
  <input type="text" name="subject" placeholder="Subject" required>
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message" required></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
</form>
```

This works immediately without any JavaScript configuration!
